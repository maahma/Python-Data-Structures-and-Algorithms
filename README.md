## üêù Study Progress
| Week | Dates | Leetcode Solved (Easy/Med/Hard) | Topics Covered | Mock Interviews | Notes | Hours spent | 
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| 1    | 03/02/25 - 09/02/25 | Some easys | Mostly arrays and hashmaps | 0 | Frustrated with leetcode. Not able to solve even Easy questions without looking at the solution. Have to change my study plan and learn how to implement data structures and algorithms from scratch before doing leetcode questions. Also look at [leetcode patterns](https://blog.algomaster.io/p/15-leetcode-patterns) to make problem-solving easier. Will restart my progress table  | A LOT |
| 2    | 10/02/25 - 16/02/25 | Doing prep work(see below) before starting leetcode | - | - | - | - |
| 3    | 17/02/25 - 23/02/25 | - | - | - | - | - |
| 4    | 24/02/25 - 02/03/25 | - | - | - | - | - |

## üçì Learning Materials
- I study learning materials on weekends to prepare for solving problems during the weekdays.
- I solve five problems a day and take notes.
- I revisit problems I struggled with the next day to reinforce my learning.
